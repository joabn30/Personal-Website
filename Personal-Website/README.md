The Portfolio Project is a responsive website designed to showcase a professional online portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It features key sections like a navigation bar, hero section, services, and a footer, all crafted with clean, modern aesthetics. 
The website adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices through the use of responsive design techniques, such as media queries.

One highlight of the project is the interactive, mobile-friendly navigation menu, providing smooth and intuitive access to different sections of the portfolio. 
This project demonstrates a strong grasp of front-end web development, focusing on user-centered design and accessibility, 
while effectively presenting content in a professional, visually appealing manner.
